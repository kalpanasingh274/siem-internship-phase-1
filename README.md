# siem-internship-phase-1
Welcome to the repository for the SIEM Internship Phase-1.
The goal of this Practical cybersecurity internship is to establish a personal SOC(Security Operations Centre)lab, simulate hostile tactics, and identify them using Splunk as the SIEM. Every use case aims to present fundamental ideas in threat detection, alerting, log gathering, and parsing.
